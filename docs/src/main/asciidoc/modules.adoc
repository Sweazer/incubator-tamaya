== Mature Extensions

Mature extensions have a stable API and SPI, similar to the API and Implementations provided.

== Draft Extensions

Extensions in _draft state_ are tested well and normally should have rather stable APIs. Nevertheless API changes may
still occurr, but we try to prevent such changes if possible.

NOTE All extensions, despite the _tamaya-builder_ module, currently run on Java 7 as well as on Java 8.

== Extensions in Experimental Stage

Extensions in _experimental mode_ may still be under discussions. API changes may still happen, so use them
very carefully and especially give us feedback, so we can improve them before progressing to _draft_ state.
